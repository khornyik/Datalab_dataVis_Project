    <div id = 'introduction'>

      <p class = 'paragraph'> Climate policy is often framed as a cost. 
        However, data from the UK Co-benefits Atlas shows that actions to reduce emissions are predicted to also generate non-trivial benefits both for public health and employment. 
        This project explores how climate action can simultaneously reduce pressure on the NHS and create green jobs — and how these benefits are distributed across communities.

        Health is One of the Largest Co-Benefits of Climate Action 
      </h3>

      <p class = 'paragraph'> 
        Reaching net zero by 2050 is projected to generate substantial health-related savings across every region of the UK. 
        These health-related savings come from reduced air pollution, warmer homes, more physical activity, and healthier diets — all of which lower the risk of chronic disease and reduce hospital admissions.

        Users can explore how benefits evolve over time and compare them with indicators such as health deprivation (health domain rank), employment deprivation (employment domain rank), new jobs per working age population and total co-benefit.

        The health domain rank describes the health deprivation score of the small area - 1 being the most deprived.
        Similarly, the job domain rank describes the employment deprivation score of the small area - 1 being the most deprived.
        Areas with poorer health should have the greatest potential to benefit from preventative climate interventions (due to the health-related savings), yet projected savings remain lower in many of the more deprived communities.

        Most projected health savings come from increased physical activity and improved air quality, with minor benefits from temperature and dampness related factors. 
        This forecasting highlights the importance of transport, urban design, and the further development of walkable neighbourhoods as public-health interventions in the future.

      <p class = 'paragraph'> 
        When health savings are compared with deprivation levels, a clear pattern emerges: less deprived areas receive higher projected health savings. 
        At the same time, the NHS burden is highest in the most deprived communities, meaning that targeted climate investment could generate even greater healthcare savings where they are most needed.

        Climate action offers a rare opportunity to deliver three public goals simultaneously: reduce NHS pressure, improve population health, support local employment. 
        With more targeted climate action goals toward high-need communities, the climate policy has the possibility to help narrow long-standing health inequalities between communities.
